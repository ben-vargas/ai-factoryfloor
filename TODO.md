# TODO

## Pre-release

- [x] Website: favicon, OG image, SEO meta tags

## Future

- [ ] Swift 6 migration (strict concurrency)
- [ ] External Chrome integration: launch with --remote-debugging-port for WebMCP/CDP
- [ ] PR management: create and manage PRs from workstreams (currently view-only)
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (Sparkle or similar)
- [ ] Crash reporting
- [ ] Move persistence from UserDefaults to a proper file (for larger state)
- [ ] Horizontal terminal splits within a tab (ghostty C API supports splits via action_cb, but surface lifecycle needs investigation)
- [ ] Preload Coding Agent terminal in background so it's ready when the user switches from Info tab
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder tabs
- [ ] Show project icon in info pages if found in a well-known location (e.g., icon.png, .github/icon.png)
- [ ] Pin ghostty submodule update to CI (auto-test against new Ghostty releases)
- [ ] Occlude non-visible terminal surfaces to save GPU (needs careful timing)
- [ ] System notifications when agent needs attention (bell/urgency from Ghostty)
- [ ] Restore full app state on launch (active tab within workstream; sidebar selection and expanded state already persisted)
